This is a project to review real estate properties.

For instance, if I lived in an apartment for some time and want to share my experience for that place, possibly to help future tenants, I should be able to share here.

Similarly, if I am considering a new place to live and want to know about the property from the people who have actually lived there, rather than the agents, so that I can make an informed decision.


Example review:

I lived at 51/65 Liverpool St., Sydney.
My stay was quite comfortable.

Good things about the property are its location (close to most of the amenities),
easy to catch public transport, saves time for commute to work.

Bad things:

Very noisy on weekend nights.
Ambulance sirens.
Space in the apartment is very less.
Air con not working.
Security is not good.
